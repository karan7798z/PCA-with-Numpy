# PCA with Numpy

This is a guided project I completed on Coursera.

In the life-cycle of this project, I learned the basics of Principal Component Analysis, the math behing the Dimensionality Reduction Technique, when to use PCA and when is PCA not an optimal technique for your use-case. I understood the matrix working behind Eigendecomposition and Singular Value Decomposition and how these techniques help in computation of the Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, which in turn help in choosing the Principal Components.

In the attached notebook, I have performed PCA on a very small dataset, to uncover how the algorithm works. 
Initially, I have performed some rudimentary EDA, followed by Standardization of the dataset (which is a requirement of the PCA Algorithm). Then I have shown both methods of computing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors (Eigendecomposition and SVD), followed by transformation of the original data, by projection on the Lower Dimensional subspace.
